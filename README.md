Analyzed Twitter data to understand public sentiment towards specific topics, products, or events.


This project typically involves the following steps:

Data Collection:

Use APIs (e.g., Twitter API) to collect social media data related to the topic of interest.
Store the collected data in a suitable format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data (remove special characters, links, hashtags, mentions, etc.).
Tokenize the text (split the text into words or tokens).
Remove stop words (common words that don't carry significant meaning).
Perform stemming or lemmatization (reduce words to their root form).

Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP techniques and libraries (e.g., NLTK, TextBlob, VADER, spaCy) to analyze the sentiment of each text.
Assign sentiment scores or labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) to each text.

Data Visualization: Aggregate the sentiment scores over time or by other relevant categories.
Use visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar charts, word clouds) to display sentiment trends.

Insights and Reporting: Interpret the visualizations to draw insights about public sentiment.
Create reports or dashboards to communicate the findings.
